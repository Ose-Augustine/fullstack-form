# fullstack-form
## Introduction 

This is a simple fullstack form. The main focus of this form is to practice my intermediate html and css skills. It doesn't really have much when it comes to aestethics, but there are relatively subtle design patterns i've picked up . The arrangement of files follows the principle of separation of concerns . Also the python files are in line with pep8 guidelines. I also used some of the more advanced features of wtforms like custom validations.

### Features 
This project has both front and backend features . The frontend is built with regular html and vanilla css so no special installation required. The backend however is running on the python microframework for web development, flask. 

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Environment

I recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) are libraries to handle the lightweight postgresql database.
